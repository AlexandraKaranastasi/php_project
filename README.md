# A few words about the project

As you can see, I have created the sign_in page in which the user can sign in as a manager or as a simple user/employee.
Then if the user is a manager, the manager_home page shows up where the manager can see the list of all users, can create a new user by clicking the related button or he/she can logout from his/her account.
If the user signs in as a user, then the user_home page shows up and there the user can logout. The rest actions of the user_home page have not been created.
Also the rest of the requirments of the project about vacation requests have not been completed.

Thank you for your time.
